          <center><h3>What is the definition of love? Love is endless, eternal even. It's limitless but complicated. No amount of words can even begin to grasp the concept of this word. Why? Because each person has a different perspective. Some may be similar but never really being exact.
          <br><br>
          Friendship, infatuation, empty love, and such. Love takes shape in many different forms and although it might be too early to say this, I am certain that this love I feel for you is consummate.
          <br><br>
          I am not good with words, as i have told you. Still, I'm here writing this, willing to try just to give you atleast a smile. Writing is not really my strongest.. so I apologise in advance. Though I think you'll just say this was cute, It just all feels cheesy to say.
          <br><br>
          If i'm being honest, i'm not really sure what to say. What's clear as day though is I want to tell you how much I appreciate you. I just think you're too humble for your own good!! It's really fine to take my compliments because it's all true. Don't even think about saying "It's because you don't know me that well yet"!! I can't deny that it may be true but I'm sure that even if I do get to know you more you'll still be one of a kind. You're thoughtful, and so very pretty as well. Pretty like seeing a sunset over a flowery field for the very first time. Although your friends may not say it as much, i'm sure they think that you're so kind as well. I admire your friendliness and ability to get along with pretty much everyone. You may not notice and may even deny but the hardwork and dedication you give to me as well as with your frienships is all just so insipring. The fact that you can even give a stranger a smile speaks so much. Even just seeing a glimpse of your heartwarming smile has a way to melt my heart. I'd want to continue but I'll save my words for later. For now you'll have to make do with this!! and...
